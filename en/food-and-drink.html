  <p class="lead">Hungry in Lombardy? Not possible. </p>
  <p>Tempting as it is to indulge in as much pizza and pasta as you can (we are in Italy, after all), rice dishes are very much the order of the day in Lombardy.

Local delicacies include some famous dishes such as ossobuco and everyoneâ€™s favourite festive Italian treat, panettone. The chefs in Lombardy might be known for the classics but they still have a few surprises - there are six Michelin-starred restaurants in the region.
